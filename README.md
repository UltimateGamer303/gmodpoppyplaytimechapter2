So, Put the .VTF and .VMT in a folder called "playtimeco" So that would look like "[steam file location here]\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\materials\playtimeco"
Then in your bin folder in "[steam file location here]\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\" open Hammer.
Click Open File.
Then go to the gm_playtimeco_ch2.vmf download directory. (Should be in the downloaded folder) and boom! You have the map!
Remember, You are free to work on this. Add your own textures, etc. Sorry about cancelling it again.

Since your here. Here is my next big project - BATDR Map. And maybe BATIM map. IDK though.
